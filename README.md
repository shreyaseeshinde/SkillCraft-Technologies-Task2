Titanic Dataset Analysis
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The primary focus is on handling missing values and understanding the distribution and relationships between variables in the dataset.

Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are: Data Cleaning: Address missing values in the dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze the dataset to understand its structure and relationships between variables.

Dataset
Dataset Used: Titanic dataset. Description: The dataset includes information about Titanic passengers, such as age, gender, class, fare, and survival status.

Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values The dataset had missing values in several columns, which were handled as follows: Age: Missing values were filled with the median age. Cabin: Missing values were filled with the mode. Body: Missing values were filled with the median. Boat: Missing values were filled with the mode. Home/Destination: Missing values were filled with the mode.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Initial Data Exploration Data Inspection: Used df.info() to understand the data types and identify columns with missing values. Univariate Analysis Objective: Analyze individual variables to understand their distribution.

Tools & Libraries
Python: Used for data cleaning and analysis. Pandas: For data manipulation. NumPy: For numerical operations.
